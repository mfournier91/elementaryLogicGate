This project corresponds with week one of nand2Tetris. Chips are implemented in Hardware Description Language.
In the project, students are provided with a nand chip and must describe an implementation for each chip listed here.
I implemented the chips in the recommended order; for each chip implementation, I only depended on the chips which I had already implemented.
Here is the recommended order:
0. Nand (provided, not implemented)
1. Not
2. And
3. Or
4. Xor
5. Mux
6. DMux
7. Not16
8. And16
9. Or16
10. Mux16
11. Or8Way
12. Mux4Way16
13. Mux8Way16
14. DMux4Way
15. DMux8Way
